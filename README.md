_In a place of stone faces, nameless survivors stand together. They have
nothing. Only a lantern to light their struggle._

[Kingdom Death: Monster](https://kingdomdeath.com/) is cooperative game for up
to 4 players. Play survivors ekeing out an existence in the overwhelming
darkness. Your story unfolds in a campaign that is played over many nights at
the game table or ends quickly in bitter defeat.

Every decision matters. Every space moved, every resource spent, every governing
principle chosen - all have lasting impact on this highly replayable and
challenging game.

## About

## Storage

This site makes use of your browser's local storage to save your data. This
means that you can close the tab or even your browser and come back later to
find your data still there. However, this also means that if you clear your
browser's local storage, your data will be lost. If you want to back up your
data, use the `Preserve Settlement Records` button on the
[Settlements](https://ncalteen.github.io/kdm/settlement/list) page.

This will download a JSON file containing all of your settlements. You can then
upload this file later to restore your settlements at any time!
