_In a place of stone faces, nameless survivors stand together. They have
nothing. Only a lantern to light their struggle._

[Kingdom Death: Monster](https://kingdomdeath.com/) is cooperative game for up
to 4 players. Play survivors ekeing out an existence in the overwhelming
darkness. Your story unfolds in a campaign that is played over many nights at
the game table or ends quickly in bitter defeat.

Every decision matters. Every space moved, every resource spent, every governing
principle chosen - all have lasting impact on this highly replayable and
challenging game.
