### Architecture

- Use functional components with hooks as the primary pattern
- Implement component composition over inheritance
- Organize components by feature or domain for scalability
- Separate presentational and container components clearly
- Use custom hooks for reusable stateful logic
- Implement proper component hierarchies with clear data flow

### TypeScript Integration

- Use TypeScript interfaces for props, state, and component definitions
- Define proper types for event handlers and refs
- Implement generic components where appropriate

### Component Design

- Follow the single responsibility principle for components
- Use descriptive and consistent naming conventions
- Implement proper prop validation with TypeScript or PropTypes
- Design components to be testable and reusable
- Keep components small and focused on a single concern
- Use composition patterns (render props, children as functions)

### State Management

- Use `useState` for local component state
- Implement `useReducer` for complex state logic
- Leverage `useContext` for sharing state across component trees
- Consider external state management (Redux Toolkit, Zustand) for complex
  applications
- Implement proper state normalization and data structures

## Additional Guidelines

- All React components should follow the same coding standards.
- All components should be written in TypeScript.
- Inputs should be uncontrolled components, unless there is a specific need for
  controlled components.
- JSDoc comments should be used to document all components.
- Input and return types should be explicitly defined.
- If a component is used to display an editable list of items, the items
  themselves should be created as separate components.
- When values are modified and saved, the component should save the values to
  localStorage following the appropriate schema.
- If the user is creating, editing, or deleting a value, the component should
  provide feedback to the user using toast notifications from the `sonner`
  library.
- If the input field is a numerical input, it should be saved on change, not on
  blur.
- If the input field is a text input, it should be saved on Enter key is
  pressed.
- ShadCN reusable components can be found in the `src/components/ui` directory.
- Where applicable, components should include `name` and `id` attributes for
  accessibility and testing purposes.

## Performance Guidelines

- Reduce calls to localStorage by passing campaign data as props where possible.
- Use `memo` for components that do not need to re-render on every state change.
- Use `useCallback` and `useMemo` hooks to optimize performance where
  applicable.
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders by ensuring that component props and state are
  managed efficiently.

### Hooks and Effects

- Use `useEffect` with proper dependency arrays to avoid infinite loops
- Implement cleanup functions in effects to prevent memory leaks
- Use `useMemo` and `useCallback` for performance optimization when needed
- Create custom hooks for reusable stateful logic
- Follow the rules of hooks (only call at the top level)
- Use `useRef` for accessing DOM elements and storing mutable values

### Styling

- Use CSS Modules, Styled Components, or modern CSS-in-JS solutions
- Implement responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Follow BEM methodology or similar naming conventions for CSS classes
- Use CSS custom properties (variables) for theming
- Implement consistent spacing, typography, and color systems
- Ensure accessibility with proper ARIA attributes and semantic HTML

### Performance Optimization

- Use `memo` for component memoization when appropriate
- Implement code splitting with `lazy` and `Suspense`
- Optimize bundle size with tree shaking and dynamic imports
- Use `useMemo` and `useCallback` judiciously to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Implement virtual scrolling for large lists
- Profile components with React DevTools to identify performance bottlenecks

### Data Fetching

- Use modern data fetching libraries (React Query, SWR, Apollo Client)
- Implement proper loading, error, and success states
- Handle race conditions and request cancellation
- Use optimistic updates for better user experience
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Handle offline scenarios and network errors gracefully

### Error Handling

- Implement Error Boundaries for component-level error handling
- Use proper error states in data fetching
- Implement fallback UI for error scenarios
- Log errors appropriately for debugging
- Handle async errors in effects and event handlers
- Provide meaningful error messages to users

### Forms and Validation

- Implement proper form validation with libraries like Formik, React Hook Form
- Handle form submission and error states appropriately
- Implement accessibility features for forms (labels, ARIA attributes)
- Use debounced validation for better user experience
- Handle file uploads and complex form scenarios

### Testing

- Write unit tests for components using React Testing Library
- Test component behavior, not implementation details
- Use Jest for test runner and assertion library
- Implement integration tests for complex component interactions
- Mock external dependencies and API calls appropriately
- Test accessibility features and keyboard navigation

### Security

- Sanitize user inputs to prevent XSS attacks
- Validate and escape data before rendering
- Use HTTPS for all external API calls
- Implement proper authentication and authorization patterns
- Avoid storing sensitive data in localStorage or sessionStorage
- Use Content Security Policy (CSP) headers

### Accessibility

- Use semantic HTML elements appropriately
- Implement proper ARIA attributes and roles
- Ensure keyboard navigation works for all interactive elements
- Provide alt text for images and descriptive text for icons
- Implement proper color contrast ratios
- Test with screen readers and accessibility tools

## Implementation Process

1. Plan component architecture and data flow
1. Set up project structure with proper folder organization
1. Define TypeScript interfaces and types
1. Implement core components with proper styling
1. Add state management and data fetching logic

## Additional Guidelines

- Follow React's naming conventions (PascalCase for components, camelCase for
  functions)
- Use meaningful commit messages and maintain clean git history
- Implement proper code splitting and lazy loading strategies
- Document complex components and custom hooks with JSDoc
- Use ESLint and Prettier for consistent code formatting
- Keep dependencies up to date and audit for security vulnerabilities

- Container/Presentational component separation
- Custom hooks for reusable logic extraction

## Code Examples

### Using the `use()` Hook (React 19)

```typescript
import { Suspense, use } from 'react'

interface User {
  id: number
  name: string
  email: string
}

async function fetchUser(id: number): Promise<User> {
  const res = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/users/${id}`)
  if (!res.ok) throw new Error('Failed to fetch user')
  return res.json()
}

function UserProfile({ userPromise }: { userPromise: Promise<User> }) {
  // use() hook suspends rendering until promise resolves
  const user = use(userPromise)

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>{user.name}</h2>
      <p>{user.email}</p>
    </div>
  )
}

export function UserProfilePage({ userId }: { userId: number }) {
  const userPromise = fetchUser(userId)

  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading user...</div>}>
      <UserProfile userPromise={userPromise} />
    </Suspense>
  )
}
```

### Form with Actions and useFormStatus (React 19)

```typescript
import { useActionState } from 'react'
import { useFormStatus } from 'react-dom'

// Submit button that shows pending state
function SubmitButton() {
  const { pending } = useFormStatus()

  return (
    <button type="submit" disabled={pending}>
      {pending ? 'Submitting...' : 'Submit'}
    </button>
  )
}

interface FormState {
  error?: string
  success?: boolean
}

// Server Action or async action
async function createPost(
  prevState: FormState,
  formData: FormData
): Promise<FormState> {
  const title = formData.get('title') as string
  const content = formData.get('content') as string

  if (!title || !content) {
    return { error: 'Title and content are required' }
  }

  try {
    const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/posts', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify({ title, content })
    })

    if (!res.ok) throw new Error('Failed to create post')

    return { success: true }
  } catch (error) {
    return { error: 'Failed to create post' }
  }
}

export function CreatePostForm() {
  const [state, formAction] = useActionState(createPost, {})

  return (
    <form action={formAction}>
      <input name="title" placeholder="Title" required />
      <textarea name="content" placeholder="Content" required />

      {state.error && <p className="error">{state.error}</p>}
      {state.success && <p className="success">Post created!</p>}

      <SubmitButton />
    </form>
  )
}
```

### Optimistic Updates with useOptimistic (React 19)

```typescript
import { useOptimistic, useState, useTransition } from 'react'

interface Message {
  id: string
  text: string
  sending?: boolean
}

async function sendMessage(text: string): Promise<Message> {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/messages', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ text })
  })
  return res.json()
}

export function MessageList({
  initialMessages
}: {
  initialMessages: Message[]
}) {
  const [messages, setMessages] = useState<Message[]>(initialMessages)
  const [optimisticMessages, addOptimisticMessage] = useOptimistic(
    messages,
    (state, newMessage: Message) => [...state, newMessage]
  )
  const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition()

  const handleSend = async (text: string) => {
    const tempMessage: Message = {
      id: `temp-${Date.now()}`,
      text,
      sending: true
    }

    // Optimistically add message to UI
    addOptimisticMessage(tempMessage)

    startTransition(async () => {
      const savedMessage = await sendMessage(text)
      setMessages((prev) => [...prev, savedMessage])
    })
  }

  return (
    <div>
      {optimisticMessages.map((msg) => (
        <div key={msg.id} className={msg.sending ? 'opacity-50' : ''}>
          {msg.text}
        </div>
      ))}
      <MessageInput onSend={handleSend} disabled={isPending} />
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Using useEffectEvent (React 19.2)

```typescript
import { useEffect, useEffectEvent, useState } from 'react'

interface ChatProps {
  roomId: string
  theme: 'light' | 'dark'
}

export function ChatRoom({ roomId, theme }: ChatProps) {
  const [messages, setMessages] = useState<string[]>([])

  // useEffectEvent extracts non-reactive logic from effects
  // theme changes won't cause reconnection
  const onMessage = useEffectEvent((message: string) => {
    // Can access latest theme without making effect depend on it
    console.log(`Received message in ${theme} theme:`, message)
    setMessages((prev) => [...prev, message])
  })

  useEffect(() => {
    // Only reconnect when roomId changes, not when theme changes
    const connection = createConnection(roomId)
    connection.on('message', onMessage)
    connection.connect()

    return () => {
      connection.disconnect()
    }
  }, [roomId]) // theme not in dependencies!

  return (
    <div className={theme}>
      {messages.map((msg, i) => (
        <div key={i}>{msg}</div>
      ))}
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Using <Activity> Component (React 19.2)

```typescript
import { Activity, useState } from 'react'

export function TabPanel() {
  const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState<'home' | 'profile' | 'settings'>(
    'home'
  )

  return (
    <div>
      <nav>
        <button onClick={() => setActiveTab('home')}>Home</button>
        <button onClick={() => setActiveTab('profile')}>Profile</button>
        <button onClick={() => setActiveTab('settings')}>Settings</button>
      </nav>

      {/* Activity preserves UI and state when hidden */}
      <Activity mode={activeTab === 'home' ? 'visible' : 'hidden'}>
        <HomeTab />
      </Activity>

      <Activity mode={activeTab === 'profile' ? 'visible' : 'hidden'}>
        <ProfileTab />
      </Activity>

      <Activity mode={activeTab === 'settings' ? 'visible' : 'hidden'}>
        <SettingsTab />
      </Activity>
    </div>
  )
}

function HomeTab() {
  // State is preserved when tab is hidden and restored when visible
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Custom Hook with TypeScript Generics

```typescript
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react'

interface UseFetchResult<T> {
  data: T | null
  loading: boolean
  error: Error | null
  refetch: () => void
}

export function useFetch<T>(url: string): UseFetchResult<T> {
  const [data, setData] = useState<T | null>(null)
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true)
  const [error, setError] = useState<Error | null>(null)
  const [refetchCounter, setRefetchCounter] = useState(0)

  useEffect(() => {
    let cancelled = false

    const fetchData = async () => {
      try {
        setLoading(true)
        setError(null)

        const response = await fetch(url)
        if (!response.ok) throw new Error(`HTTP error ${response.status}`)

        const json = await response.json()

        if (!cancelled) {
          setData(json)
        }
      } catch (err) {
        if (!cancelled) {
          setError(err instanceof Error ? err : new Error('Unknown error'))
        }
      } finally {
        if (!cancelled) {
          setLoading(false)
        }
      }
    }

    fetchData()

    return () => {
      cancelled = true
    }
  }, [url, refetchCounter])

  const refetch = () => setRefetchCounter((prev) => prev + 1)

  return { data, loading, error, refetch }
}

// Usage with type inference
function UserList() {
  const { data, loading, error } = useFetch<User[]>(
    'https://api.example.com/users'
  )

  if (loading) return <div>Loading...</div>
  if (error) return <div>Error: {error.message}</div>
  if (!data) return null

  return (
    <ul>
      {data.map((user) => (
        <li key={user.id}>{user.name}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}
```

### Error Boundary with TypeScript

```typescript
import { Component, ErrorInfo, ReactNode } from 'react'

interface Props {
  children: ReactNode
  fallback?: ReactNode
}

interface State {
  hasError: boolean
  error: Error | null
}

export class ErrorBoundary extends Component<Props, State> {
  constructor(props: Props) {
    super(props)
    this.state = { hasError: false, error: null }
  }

  static getDerivedStateFromError(error: Error): State {
    return { hasError: true, error }
  }

  componentDidCatch(error: Error, errorInfo: ErrorInfo) {
    console.error('Error caught by boundary:', error, errorInfo)
    // Log to error reporting service
  }

  render() {
    if (this.state.hasError) {
      return (
        this.props.fallback || (
          <div role="alert">
            <h2>Something went wrong</h2>
            <details>
              <summary>Error details</summary>
              <pre>{this.state.error?.message}</pre>
            </details>
            <button
              onClick={() => this.setState({ hasError: false, error: null })}>
              Try again
            </button>
          </div>
        )
      )
    }

    return this.props.children
  }
}
```

### Using cacheSignal for Resource Cleanup (React 19.2)

```typescript
import { cache, cacheSignal, use } from 'react'

// Cache with automatic cleanup when cache expires
const fetchUserData = cache(async (userId: string) => {
  const controller = new AbortController()
  const signal = cacheSignal()

  // Listen for cache expiration to abort the fetch
  signal.addEventListener('abort', () => {
    console.log(`Cache expired for user ${userId}`)
    controller.abort()
  })

  try {
    const response = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/users/${userId}`, {
      signal: controller.signal
    })

    if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Failed to fetch user')
    return await response.json()
  } catch (error) {
    if (error.name === 'AbortError') {
      console.log('Fetch aborted due to cache expiration')
    }
    throw error
  }
})

// Usage in component
function UserProfile({ userId }: { userId: string }) {
  const user = use(fetchUserData(userId))

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>{user.name}</h2>
      <p>{user.email}</p>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Ref as Prop - No More forwardRef (React 19)

```typescript
import { Ref, useRef } from "react"

// React 19: ref is now a regular prop!
interface InputProps {
  placeholder?: string
  ref?: Ref<HTMLInputElement> // ref is just a prop now
}

// No need for forwardRef anymore
function CustomInput({ placeholder, ref }: InputProps) {
  return <input ref={ref} placeholder={placeholder} className="custom-input" />
}

// Usage
function ParentComponent() {
  const inputRef = useRef<HTMLInputElement>(null)

  const focusInput = () => {
    inputRef.current?.focus()
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <CustomInput ref={inputRef} placeholder="Enter text" />
      <button onClick={focusInput}>Focus Input</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Context Without Provider (React 19)

```typescript
import { createContext, useContext, useState } from 'react'

interface ThemeContextType {
  theme: 'light' | 'dark'
  toggleTheme: () => void
}

// Create context
const ThemeContext = createContext<ThemeContextType | undefined>(undefined)

// React 19: Render context directly instead of Context.Provider
function App() {
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState<'light' | 'dark'>('light')

  const toggleTheme = () => {
    setTheme((prev) => (prev === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light'))
  }

  const value = { theme, toggleTheme }

  // Old way: <ThemeContext.Provider value={value}>
  // New way in React 19: Render context directly
  return (
    <ThemeContext value={value}>
      <Header />
      <Main />
      <Footer />
    </ThemeContext>
  )
}

// Usage remains the same
function Header() {
  const { theme, toggleTheme } = useContext(ThemeContext)!

  return (
    <header className={theme}>
      <button onClick={toggleTheme}>Toggle Theme</button>
    </header>
  )
}
```

### Ref Callback with Cleanup Function (React 19)

```typescript
import { useState } from 'react'

function VideoPlayer() {
  const [isPlaying, setIsPlaying] = useState(false)

  // React 19: Ref callbacks can now return cleanup functions!
  const videoRef = (element: HTMLVideoElement | null) => {
    if (element) {
      console.log('Video element mounted')

      // Set up observers, listeners, etc.
      const observer = new IntersectionObserver((entries) => {
        entries.forEach((entry) => {
          if (entry.isIntersecting) {
            element.play()
          } else {
            element.pause()
          }
        })
      })

      observer.observe(element)

      // Return cleanup function - called when element is removed
      return () => {
        console.log('Video element unmounting - cleaning up')
        observer.disconnect()
        element.pause()
      }
    }
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <video ref={videoRef} src="/video.mp4" controls />
      <button onClick={() => setIsPlaying(!isPlaying)}>
        {isPlaying ? 'Pause' : 'Play'}
      </button>
    </div>

### Document Metadata in Components (React 19)

```typescript
// React 19: Place metadata directly in components
// React will automatically hoist these to <head>
function BlogPost({ post }: { post: Post }) {
  return (
    <article>
      {/* These will be hoisted to <head> */}
      <title>{post.title} - My Blog</title>
      <meta name="description" content={post.excerpt} />
      <meta property="og:title" content={post.title} />
      <meta property="og:description" content={post.excerpt} />
      <link rel="canonical" href={`https://myblog.com/posts/${post.slug}`} />

      {/* Regular content */}
      <h1>{post.title}</h1>
      <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: post.content }} />
    </article>
  )
}
```

### useDeferredValue with Initial Value (React 19)

```typescript
import { useDeferredValue, useState, useTransition } from 'react'

interface SearchResultsProps {
  query: string
}

function SearchResults({ query }: SearchResultsProps) {
  // React 19: useDeferredValue now supports initial value
  // Shows "Loading..." initially while first deferred value loads
  const deferredQuery = useDeferredValue(query, 'Loading...')

  const results = useSearchResults(deferredQuery)

  return (
    <div>
      <h3>Results for: {deferredQuery}</h3>
      {deferredQuery === 'Loading...' ? (
        <p>Preparing search...</p>
      ) : (
        <ul>
          {results.map((result) => (
            <li key={result.id}>{result.title}</li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      )}
    </div>
  )
}

function SearchApp() {
  const [query, setQuery] = useState('')
  const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition()

  const handleSearch = (value: string) => {
    startTransition(() => {
      setQuery(value)
    })
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <input
        type="search"
        onChange={(e) => handleSearch(e.target.value)}
        placeholder="Search..."
      />
      {isPending && <span>Searching...</span>}
      <SearchResults query={query} />
    </div>
  )
}
```
